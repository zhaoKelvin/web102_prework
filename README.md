## Notes

The most challenging parts of building the app were most definitely going off directions after completing the required challenges and implementing my own features. Instead of having spoonfed instructions I was forced to look for my own solutions from the web to implement. Completely implementing any additional feature was a struggle as rarely did initial solutions result in the way I wanted, and it only took countless attempts of problem-solving and testing before finally getting the feature to work or scrapping the idea entirely.

An honorable mention is the usage of arrow and reduce/filter functions as I was unfamiliar with the syntax and how they worked.
